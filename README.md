# DMP Roadmap Development Environment

This is the easiest way to get started with DMP Roadmap, as it sets up and deploys a (largely) platform-agnostic and totally sandboxed development environment based on:
* Docker/Vagrant/Puppet
* CentOS 7/nginx/MySQL/Ruby on Rails

## Requirements
* [Docker v1.10.3](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation) (Mac/Windows users might need [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox))
* [Vagrant v1.8.1](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

## Instructions
1. Clone this configuration repository
  * ```shell
  falafels```
